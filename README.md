# DroneGuidanceProject
The purpose of this project is to guide a person on his way to a predetermined destination using a drone without colliding with obstacles. Here you can find all the modules of the system. in this project we used the DJI Tello Drone. but the DJITelloPy will work on any of their Drones since we used the 2.0V SDK.
